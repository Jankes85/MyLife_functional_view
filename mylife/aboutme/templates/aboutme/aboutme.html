    <h2>A few words about me</h2>
    <p>I am a beginner Python programmer who wants to gain new skills and experience in the IT industry. I have
        analytical skills and thanks to my previous experience I can work well in a team. I gain my knowledge from
        online courses, e.g. Udemy, from industry literature, to later verify what I've learned by solving tasks on
        Codewars.
    </p>
    <p>I am motivated by the possibility of personal development and the new challenges that I am looking forward to.
